Data science as a nascent academic field grows rapidly in many disciplines, and the understanding of data science vastly differs depending on individuals and organizations. Lack of common understanding blurs the shared goal among data science institutions and hampers their potential collaborative effort. 

The goal of this research project is to examine what data science is by observing what data science institutions do. We aim to coordinate and improve research collaboration among data science institutions based on their strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, this project simplifies data science ecosystem comparison among universities through the automated characterization process.
